# Passive-Wind-Measurement

This source code includes the algorithm that was designed to correlate wind speed with mirage patterns. The oscillation of 
pixels of interests within mirage videos were calculated based on the latter's postion over time from a reference position. 
The resulting output is a graph of frequency versus actual wind speed, which allows the user to determine the wind speed based 
on the computed frequency of oscillation. 

This projecct package contains the source code used for the project as well as the pre-processed videos that were fed to the
program.
